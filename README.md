# Tinyurl
Here I have added a URL minified algo: One tinify URL method is written. 
 
 Changes

 	1. Bootstrap to change the UI
 	2. Decorator to work with URLmapper object using draper gem
 	3. Top 100 sites are coming based on visit_count 
 	
 Some changes which i can  do but due to lack of time i won't
 If you'll check my commit its a single day built in app.

 Suggested improvment

 	1. Redis cache to fast showing 100 sites (Board)
 	2. UI is needed many changes eg after URL creation we can show in the same page & UI changes needed in overall application.
 	3. pagination is needed can be done by gem 'kaminari'
